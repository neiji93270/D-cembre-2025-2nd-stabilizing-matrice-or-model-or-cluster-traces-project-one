//the bottleneck here would be to overcome asymptotic
//values that differs from real numbers on a dirzv equation
//form suited for heat transfer. we dont need mass transfer then here this deal with several models.
//the oarc model must be fullfilled with black boxes if datas are extreme isotropic values
//then this will be a topology algorithm mainly. the remaining part would be to not post process the traces of black boxes models.
//so we do it twicd this is what we want to prevent errors lookup.
//plus, the dpin would be kept in another topologiczl equation. so the forces acting on oarc and black boxes models are not safe.
//but havin bad valies for spins algebras is not a bad thing if we think it seriously (another topoc).
